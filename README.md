# tedge-demo-container
thin-edge.io demo container setup to showcase thin-edge.io and all its features

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§

## Pre-requisites

The following pre-requisites are required before you can get started:

* docker
* docker compose v2 (e.g. not the python one ;))

## Getting started locally

First you may need to install [just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_1.html) as it is used as the task runner.

1. Create the `.env` template file

    ```sh
    just create-env
    ```

    Fill in the values for each of the environment variables in the [.env](./.env) file.

2. Start the docker compose project

    ```sh
    just up
    ```

3. Bootstrap the main device (don't worry you only have to do this once)

    ```sh
    just bootstrap
    ```

    You will be prompted for the required details. You can hit `<enter>` to accept the default values.

4. Click on the device link shown on your console

5. That's it ðŸš€
